# Simple Todo App

This is an Todo list that can add your tasks with due dates and be marked complete once finished. 

## Functionality

This project is a simple to do list. You can add events that hold a description and a date in US English Standard Dates. 
There are Checkboxes to complete each task as well a delete button for tasks. 

## Technology
This project is for refactoring using OOP. Ther were two files created FormValidator and Todo. Inside FormValidator we refactor the form validation wich checks validity of the submission, toggles button states and adds input errors. The Todo is refactored to show the actual Todo list it includes template, checkboxes, and the date. Both of these are then exported from their files and inported to our Index.js

In const there are pregenerated todos. To track these we use a CDN called UUID. The CDN is imported in to our index.js. This allows us to use the external package in our progam. 

## Deployment
